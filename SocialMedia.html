					text messenger platform back then where users were able to communicate with other users. However, not every application
					that was created in that time frame is dead today, a lot of them are still being used. A great example is Facebook,
					it was created in 2006 and it has been number one social network platform since then. Another example is Instagram, it
					was created in 2010 and it is still being used till this day. Although, these platforms have changed, a lot of new
					features has been added to enhance users’ experience.</p>
