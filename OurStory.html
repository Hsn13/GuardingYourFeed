								<span>Summary</span><br>
								<p> In the beginning, all of us met in campus to decide on a subject to write about and went into details by dividing subtopics and pages. We used an online tool that generated color pallets to use in our project. At first, a group member suggested a variation of purple and brown shades, however, we faced a challenge in finding the perfect picture for our homepage. Eventually, we found a collection of blue and beige colors that suited our theme. The most challenging and time-consuming task was designing the first mock-up design of our homepage. We spent 3 hours designing the first page and finally decided on an object-oriented style where each topic is placed in a dedicated division.  
								<br>
								<br>
								After the first physical meeting, we conducted an online meeting to finish designing the mock-up for our subtopics. We found that meeting online was much more efficient and convenient to all group members. The subtopic design was quite simple and consistent with all three subtopics. After finishing that second meeting, it was a smooth sail. We divided our pages so each group member would individually research, design, and implement a page their assigned topic. After a quiet couple of weeks, it was decided to meet again to collect and review our web pages to finally begin writing the process of our work. While collecting the individual pages, we found that our designs were quite basic and simple. We aimed to improve our skills so we can make our website more sophisticated and interesting to the eye. A couple of group members took their time to research new ways to improve the overall style and were able to successfully implement them and persuade the rest of the members to improve their designs as well.  </p>

				<span>Challenges</span><br>
				<p>
				In the primary design phase, we found difficulties to lay our content and organize the final layout in a way that was user-friendly and readable, which we overcame by looking at online inspirations that matched our vision. While designing a web page, choosing the color and design is just as important as coding the actual page. It was challenging to find a simple yet elegant theme that suited all the group members preferences, but we eventually found common ground that all agreed on. Then, some members faced issues where divisions would shift and disrupt the layout when resizing a page. Halfway through our designing phase, it came to our attention that certain fonts we used are not compatible with the requirements. Unfortunately, we had no option but select another font that was suitable to our design. As our selected font “Georgia” is used specifically for reporting news. Moreover, it was hard to find images that fit our theme of color and design, it was a long search and a lot of trial and error to find an image that was related to our subject, was easy to adjust to our liking, and fit our theme.

				<span>What we learned</span><br>
				<p>
				We learned new ways to implement new CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties that were not included in our course (e.i manipulating hover property to an image, editing the text decorations and spacing, overflow property to organize divisions, border radius property to change the appearance of a button/input objects.) As mentioned earlier, the color and design are an important aspect of a webpage, so we had more experience using colors to edit the final look of our page, like using darker vibrant colors for headings, lighter neutral colors for backgrounds. Overall, working in a group project improved our communication and time management skills. We learned when to either assign individual tasks to members or work simultaneously in a group to save time and increase efficiency.
